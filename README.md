# PnR-Flow-Digital-Tx-System
Complete RTL-to-GDSII physical design flow for a Digital Transmitter system using Synopsys tools (Design Compiler, ICC2, StarRC, PrimeTime). Includes synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, extraction, and STA. Three flows evaluated for area, timing, and power to study PPA trade-offs in real ASIC implementation.
